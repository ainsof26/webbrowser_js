  <!--
  Import an external js file here
  So no javascript code anymore in this HTML file, which makes
  this file more of unadulterated information not any of control.
  Also this is good for
  eliminating unnecessary reiterations of code, and
  the efficiency of maintenance.
  The browser keeps js files for later use, which helps html files to be loaded faster.
